            What We Know So Far: In August 2019, Coogler turned in his treatment
            and spent the following year writing the script for Black Panther2,
            only for star Chadwick Boseman to tragically pass away on August
            28th. Filming was tentatively slated to begin in 2021, but no one at
            Marvel knew the extent of Boseman's illness. Kevin Feige revealed in
            December 2020 that the role of T'Challa will not be recast. The
            film's title was revealed on May 3, 2021, to be Black Panther:
            Wakanda Forever, and Feige subsequently confirmed that all the main
            cast from Black Panther would be returning as filming quietly began
            in July 2021 in Atlanta and wrapped in March 2022. Tenoch Huerta has
            been announced as Namor the Submariner. At Comic-Con 2022, Wakanda
            Forever was announced as the final film of Phase Four.

            What We Know So Far: In November 2019, Marvel Studios announced that
            Peyton Reed would return to direct a third Ant-Man movie. Rick and
            Morty screenwriter Jeff Loveless was subsequently hired to write the
            script, and Kathryn Newton has joined the cast as an older version
            of Scott Lang's daughter Cassie while Jonathan Majors will play the
            villain Kang the Conqueror, a variant of whom first popped up in
            Loki. Filming began in February 2021, but it had a troubled
            production. Principal photography ended in November 2021 and the
            film has entered post-production. The movie swapped places with The
            Marvels and the title plus the inclusion of Kang implies we will be
            in store for more confusing in-universe timeline shenanigans. This
            movie marks the first movie of Phase Five.

            What We Know So Far: The third Guardians of the Galaxy movie was
            originally supposed to start production in early 2019, but
            writer/director James Gunn was fired off the film last fall
            following the resurfacing of some bad jokes he made on Twitter years
            ago. Unbeknownst to the public, Gunn continued to meet with
            executives at Disney in the interim period, after he took a job
            writing and directing The Suicide Squad for DC, and it was announced
            in March 2019 that Gunn was being re-hired to direct the film. The
            intended 2020 release date was pushed back, and production won’t
            begin until after Gunn finishes The Suicide Squad, but through all
            the turmoil Marvel Studios kept Gunn’s completed script. So he’ll
            get to close out the trilogy as he originally intended. Filming
            began in November 2021 and wrapped May 2022. Additional cast
            revealed include The Suicide Squad's Daniela Melchior in an
            unspecified role. After Thor: Love and Thunder, we know that the
            gang includes Star-Lord, Drax, Groot, Rocket, Nebula, Mantis, and
            Kraglin, but before the official movie drops, there is a holiday
            special at the end of this year. Gunn has said that the special,
            taking place between Love and Thunder and Vol. 3, will be essential
            viewing for the current MCU saga. The special takes place between
            Love and Thunder and Vol. 3. During Comic-Con 2022, Chukwudi Iwuji
            was announced as the villain for the film, the High Evolutionary,
            and Maria Bakalova as the voice for Cosmo the Spacedog.

            What We Know So Far: Captain Marvel2, officially titled The Marvels,
            will be set in present-day, but directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck
            are not returning behind the camera. Marvel subsequently enlisted
            Nia DaCosta, director of the Candymanremake, to take the helm. Iman
            Vellani, who will play Ms. Marvel in her own Disney+ series, will
            have a supporting role in the film while Teyonah Parris will reprise
            her role as the adult Monica Rambeau, first debuting in the Disney+
            series WandaVision. The film's villain will be played by Zawe
            Ashton. Filming for The Marvels began May 2021 and wrapped May 2022.

            What We Know So Far: The sequel to Shang-Chi and the Legend of the
            Ten Rings was announced in December 2021, bringing back director
            Destin Daniel Cretton as the director and writer of the sequel. Not
            much is known about the story or where Shang-Chi will be going,
            though it's implied from the post-credits that it might involve the
            origin of his father's Ten Rings. Simu Liu is, of course, returning
            as the titular character. Although not confirmed, it's likely we
            will see Meng'er Zhang return as Xu Xialing as well, now that she is
            the new leader of the Ten Rings organization.
